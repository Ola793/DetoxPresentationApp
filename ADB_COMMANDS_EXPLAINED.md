# ADB Commands Explained

## What is ADB?

**ADB** stands for **Android Debug Bridge** - it's a command-line tool that lets you communicate with Android devices (emulators or physical devices).

Think of it as a "remote control" for Android devices from your computer.

---

## The Command: `adb shell input keyevent 82`

Let's break this down piece by piece:

### `adb`
- The Android Debug Bridge command-line tool
- Installed automatically with Android SDK
- Located in: `%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools\adb.exe`

### `shell`
- Opens a shell (command-line interface) on the Android device
- Allows you to run Linux commands on the Android device
- Everything after `shell` is executed on the device, not your computer

### `input`
- An Android shell command for simulating input events
- Can simulate touches, swipes, key presses, etc.
- Part of the Android OS

### `keyevent`
- A subcommand of `input` for simulating key presses
- Sends hardware key events to the device
- Equivalent to physically pressing a button

### `82`
- The key code number for the "Menu" button
- In React Native, this opens the Dev Menu
- Different numbers represent different keys

**Full Translation:**
> "Hey Android device, simulate pressing the Menu button (key code 82)"

## How Detox Uses ADB

Detox uses ADB behind the scenes to:

1. **Launch the emulator** - Starts the Android Virtual Device
2. **Install the app** - Deploys your APK
3. **Run tests** - Communicates with the app through native code
4. **Capture screenshots** - Takes screenshots on test failures
5. **Get device state** - Checks if device is ready

You don't usually need to run ADB commands manually when using Detox, but understanding them helps with debugging.

## Using ADB for Debugging

### Check if Device is Connected
```bash
adb devices
```
**Expected output:**
```
List of devices attached
emulator-5554   device
```

If you see `offline` or `unauthorized`, restart adb:
```bash
adb kill-server
adb start-server
```

### Monitor What's Happening
```bash
adb logcat | grep -i "detox"
```
**What it does:** Filters logs to show only Detox-related messages

### Check App is Installed
```bash
adb shell pm list packages | grep detoxpresentation
```
**Output:** `package:com.detoxpresentationapp`

## For Your Presentation

### Demo Opening Dev Menu

```

**Talking Points:**
- "ADB is the bridge between our computer and the Android device"
- "Key code 82 is the menu button that opens React Native's Dev Menu"
- "This is the same as pressing Ctrl + M"
- "Detox uses ADB behind the scenes to control the device during tests"

## Quick Reference for Presentation

### Open Dev Menu (3 Ways)
1. **Keyboard:** `Ctrl + M` (while emulator focused)
2. **ADB:** `adb shell input keyevent 82`
3. **Shake:** Physical shake on real device

# Is emulator running?
adb devices

# Is app installed?

# View app logs
adb logcat | grep -i "ReactNative"
```
